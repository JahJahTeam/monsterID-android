MonsterID-android
=================

MonsterID is a method of generating a unique monster image based upon a certain identifier, usually based on IP address, email address or something similar. Itâ€™s used to automatically create a personal avatar image in blog comments  and community sites.

I decided to make my own implementation for android. 

You can learn more about it at: http://www.splitbrain.org/projects/monsterid

###### How it works:

1. Convert your email/name/ip in md5
2. Use first 12 bytes to generate random numbers
3. Get parts of monsters with random numbers
4. Put parts of monster together and colorize them
